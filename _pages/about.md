I am a [Postdoctoral Scholar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/352663) in AI at [Stanford University](), under the supervision of [Prof. Mark Musen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FmMT4CcAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. (with summa cum laude) in computer science at [University of Stuttgart](), Germany and the [Intl. Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). 
My PhD was funded by the [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship](). I was an associate member of the [TrustAGI Lab](https://trust-agi.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Shirui Pan](). I have published 20+ papers and/or served as PC in premier AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, ACL, WWW, EMNLP, NAACL, SIGIR, AAAI, ECAI, ISWC, etc., and received the Best Student Paper Award of ISWC'22. 

I conduct research in AI and ML with a special emphasis on advancing the representation of human knowledge. In particular, I explore two core paradigms of knowledge
<br>
1) **Symbolic knowledge**: Knowledge graphs, ontology, semantic web, logic, etc. 
<br>
2) **Neural (implciti) knowledge**: Large language models, graph/relational embeddings. 

By bridging these two forms of representations (neuro-symbolic), I aim to develop **reliable** and **interpretable** AI systems allowing for learning, reasoning, and adapting into real domains.
